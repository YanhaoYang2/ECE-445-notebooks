# 2025-09-18 - Discussion with Professor Kumar and Gayatri

After meeting with Professor Kumar, we now have a clear roadmap for our project. We need to carefully calculate the torque required to lift a 2 lb weight and select our servo and motor driver accordingly. This calculation is critical to ensure our lifting mechanism has adequate power for the competition.
Battery selection requires careful consideration of both size and weight. The battery must have sufficient capacity to power the robot for the full 2-minute battle duration while maintaining enough energy to lift opponent robots. We'll need to calculate battery life to ensure it lasts throughout the entire match without running out of power.
Professor Kumar emphasized an important point about our strategy: our robot doesn't need to be fast or high-speed. Our winning strategy is to flip opponents using our shovel mechanism, so we should focus our design efforts on maximizing that capability. He also advised us to clearly identify our win condition and design around that objective.
Additionally, I spoke with Gayatri about where we can 3D print our battlebot structure, which will be an important next step in bringing our design to life.
